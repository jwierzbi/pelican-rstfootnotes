Plug in for customising footnotes generated by Docutils.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-rstfootnotes

## Requirements

All of the requirements should be installed automatically with the plug in but
if for some reason this doesn't happen here's command line to install all
dependencies:

    python -m pip install html5lib

## Usage

Plugin will replace all footnote tables generated by Docutils with a bullet
list by default.

There is a setting that allows changing the bullet list to definition list:

```python
RST_FOOTNOTES_TYPE = 'DEFINITION_LIST'
```

Just put this setting in your *pelicanconf.py* and you're good to go.
